<p dir="ltr">
    The JaxCorp DAO vision is to generate sustainable income and financial
    literacy to the people who need it the most. The JaxCorp DAO mission is to
    develop and build a platform for generating and distributing universal
    basic income (UBI), in the form of free WJAX Tokens. We intend to achieve
    this through smart contracts, in order to facilitate the issuance, holding
    and transfer of WJAX Tokens.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    The UBI will be distributed to users by allowing them to claim WJAX Tokens
    periodically, after they have verified their unique identity after doing
    the KYC.

<p dir="ltr">
    JaxCorp DAO aims to provide its users with UBI in the form of WJAX Tokens,
    and to that end, it needs to enforce a one-user one-account policy.
    Therefore, only verified users shall be able to receive WJAX Tokens. In
    order for you to participate in the JaxCorp DAO scheme and claim the
    tokens, you must, through our website, connect your Metamask wallet to
    register. Then verify the user's unique identity, through KYC verification.
    And the final step is to claim your UBI.

<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    Following the KYC verification, you may be entitled to make periodical
    Claims of WJAX Tokens, and receive WJAX Tokens through the smart contract
    to your Metamask Wallet. UBI is granted to you free of any charge and you
    hereby waive any claim against JaxCorp DAO in connection with any
    malfunction of the Services and/or your dissatisfaction thereof.
</h3>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    Please note that you need to have a certain amount of BNB (BEP-20) / Matic
    or the native token of the L-2 where the UBI contract resides, in your
    wallet in order to register for UBI, as the smart contract collects gas
    fees. JaxCorp DAO has no access to the funds collected in the form of gas
    fees as they are used to reward the owners of the nodes who validate the
    transactions.

    risks set forth hereinafter:
</p>
<ul>
    <li dir="ltr">
        <p dir="ltr">
            Risk of software weaknesses: The User understands and accepts that
            there is no warranty with respect to the process for receipt, use
            and ownership of WJAX Tokens will be uninterrupted or without any
            error and that there is an inherent risk that the software and
            related technologies could contain weaknesses, vulnerabilities or
            bugs causing, inter alia, the complete loss of your WJAX Tokens.

    <li dir="ltr">
        <p dir="ltr">
            Regulatory risk: The User understands and accepts that blockchain
            technology allows new forms of interaction and that it is possible
            that certain jurisdictions will apply existing regulations on, or
            introduce new regulations addressing, blockchain technology-based
            applications, which may be contrary to the current setup of JaxCorp
            DAO and which may, inter alia, result in substantial modifications
            of the JaxCorp DAO model, including its termination and the loss of
            WJAX Tokens.
        </p>

        <p dir="ltr">
            Risk of abandonment: Users understand and accept that the
            distribution and the development of the JaxCorp DAO platform may be
            abandoned for a number of reasons, including lack of interest from
            the public and lack of funding.
